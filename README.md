# Project idea

We are going to develop a mobile app that tells which of oneâ€™s Facebook friends are pessimistic or optimistic using Sentiment analysis on their posts history. A user must log in to the app with their Facebook account and allow required access permissions. Then the app generates a list of pessimistic and optimistic friends of the user. Our app considers the friends who usually post positive things as optimistic, otherwise as pessimistic.

We are going to use various Machine learning algorithms from naive to advanced and are going to compare their results. The best algorithm (or combined) is going to be used for our mobile app.
